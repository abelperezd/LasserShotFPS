# LasserShotFPS
In this repository we find a FPS game developed in Unity. I have based my work on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unityfpsgame/).

We have the necessary files to load the project and an executable inside the Builds folder. Also, in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxdQnvOn5ww&list=PLB9_8zTTrVjrCGwse6iae4oY9OeJVtho_&index=8) you can find a demo video. 

This project was developed with learning purposes.
